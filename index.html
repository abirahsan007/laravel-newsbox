<h1>Covid-19 Pandemic </h1>

<section>
<h2>Origin</h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>Coronaviruses are a group of related RNA viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds.
    In humans and birds, they cause respiratory tract infections that can range from mild to lethal.
    Mild illnesses in humans include some cases of the common cold (which is also caused by other viruses, predominantly rhinoviruses),
    while more lethal varieties can cause SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. In cows and pigs they cause diarrhea,
    while in mice they cause hepatitis and encephalomyelitis.
    There are as yet no vaccines or antiviral drugs to prevent or treat human coronavirus infections.

<h3>History</h3>
<p><i>
    Human coronaviruses were discovered in the 1960s[22][23] using two different methods in the United Kingdom
    and the United States.[24] E.C. Kendall, Malcolm Bynoe, and David Tyrrell working at the Common Cold Unit of
    the British Medical Research Council collected a unique common cold virus designated B814 in 1961.
    The virus could not be cultivated using standard techniques which had successfully cultivated rhinoviruses,
    adenoviruses and other known common cold viruses. In 1965, Tyrrell and Bynoe successfully cultivated the novel
    virus by serially passing it through organ culture of human embryonic trachea.[28] The new cultivating method
    was introduced to the lab by Bertil Hoorn.[29] The isolated virus when intranasally inoculated into volunteers
    caused a cold and was inactivated by ether which indicated it had a lipid envelope.[25][30] Dorothy Hamre[31]
    and John Procknow at the University of Chicago isolated a novel cold from medical students in 1962. T
    hey isolated and grew the virus in kidney tissue culture, assigning it as 229E. The novel virus caused a
    cold in volunteers and was inactivated by ether similarly as B814.
